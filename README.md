# Overview
Setup Fedora Workstation post installation for home use. 
- Why?
  - I've wanted to learn ansible for some time and this was a good learning opportunity.
  - Just so much easier to reinstall and get going again!
- Sharing for educational purposes after reviewing some other similar repos on GitHub which were helpful in the learning process. Hope it helps someone get started.
- **Use at your own risk!**
  
## Requirements
- Fresh installation of Fedora Workstation.
  - Tested with Fedora 38 and Gnome 44.
- Ansible
- Git

```shell
sudo dnf install ansible git -y
git clone git@github.com:steve-rackham/ansible-workstation.git
```
